# SnoreGuard Sprint Log

## 2026-05-06 — Phase 0: Project Kickoff

### Completed
- docs/IdeaBrief.md
- docs/Roadmap.md (V1/V1.1/V2 features)
- docs/FeatureTracker.md + 6 per-feature trackers (f1–f6)
- docs/ProjectArchitecture.md (deviations from IceCubes documented)
- docs/features/ directory created
- 9 SPM packages scaffolded and compiling:
  - Models, AudioEngine, Env, DesignSystem
  - Onboarding, SleepSession, Statistics, Recordings, Settings
- App entry point with onboarding gate + 3-tab structure
- Background audio build setting configured
- .swiftformat with 2-space indent
- Build verified: zero errors

### Blockers
- Notion database creation blocked — API version 2025-09-03 removed programmatic DB creation.
  - Workaround: Local trackers are primary source of truth.
  - If needed, Notion workspace can be set up manually per docs/VIBE_CODING_WORKFLOW.md Step 4.

### Next Session
- Start F1 (Onboarding) — F1-T1: Onboarding state + UserPreferences flag
